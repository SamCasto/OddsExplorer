#Description: Streamlit site that gets betting information from TheOdds API and displays it for 
#   users to make more beneficial bets for themselves.
#Goals: 
#   1. Add some kind of cache function for the league data page to limit API calls
#   2. Add more scores check functionality and maybe a way to limit the API calls
#   3. Clean up word choice across site
