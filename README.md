# OddsExplorer
A final project from FIU that is being updated. Streamlit web app that uses the odds API to display relevant betting information to users as well as relevant NFL information

This repository will hold all relevant files except my API keys file and will be updated when changes to the private repository are made. The link to the site is currently being worked on.
